description = "A lightweight Fairchild ChannelF / Video Entertainment System designed for libretro. This core was written specifically for use with low-power devices, such as Raspberry Pi, and supports loading a 'no cart' ROM to play the built-in games, controller swapping and dual-analog controls. The core requires the sl31253 and sl31254 BIOS images but the sl90025 BIOS will supersede the sl31253 version if found."
