description = "An up-to-date libretro port of the venerable Game Boy Advance emulator, VisualBoy Advance-Merged. In addition to Game Boy Advance, this core also supports Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Super Game Boy (borders and palette, only). Most users should start with this VBA-M core and only fall back to the older VBA-Next core if they need the additional performance boost at the cost of reduced accuracy and compatibility."
