description = "A port of the FS-UAE Amiga emulator to libretro. The core expects a kickstart to be located in the user's 'saves' directory, in a subdirectory named fsue/Kickstarts. Most users will be better served by the PUAE core, which has received more work to integrate it with libretro and to make it usable with just a gamepad."
