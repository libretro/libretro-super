description = "Based on a snapshot of the MAME codebase circa 2015, 'MAME 2015' is compatible with MAME 0.160 ROM sets. MAME is the most compatible emulator in the world, and it can run almost any game from any platform (though running console games through this core requires additional steps). If your device can run the up-to-date MAME - Current core (or any other newer snapshot) at full speed, most users will have a better experience with that core, while FBNeo is typically a better choice for speed vs accuracy, as long as it supports the game(s) in question."
