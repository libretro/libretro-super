description = "A port of the a5200 Atari 5200 emulator to libretro. Based on Atari800 2.0.2 and originally developed for the GCW Zero, this core runs fast on low-powered hardware. With a design focussed on ease of use and good libretro integration, the core is intended as a simple 'plug and play' solution for Atari 5200 content."
