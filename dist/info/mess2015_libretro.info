description = "A port of the MESS Multi-Emulator Super System circa 2015 to libretro. This core supports a vast array of consoles and computers, but most users are better served by using the up-to-date MAME-current core, which includes all of this same compatibility but with up-to-date MAME's accuracy and software fixes."
