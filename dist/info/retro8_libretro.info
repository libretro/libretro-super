description = "A port of the Retro8 open-source reimplementation of the PICO-8 fantasy console to libretro. This core can load both p8 'cart' files and embedded png images, and much of the PICO-8 API is working with good performance, including basic sound and music, though it is still missing some obscure Lua extension quirks and fixed arithmetic support."
