description = "Based on a snapshot of the Final Burn Alpha codebase from circa 2012, 'FB Alpha 2012 Neo Geo' is compatible with FB Alpha v0.2.97.29 ROM sets. This core variant is for Neo-Geo games only. It exists solely for use with RAM-constrained platforms, such as certain console or embedded platforms, that do not have the capacity to load the full core along with large games. Most users should use up-to-date FBNeo instead."
