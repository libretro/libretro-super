description = "A WIP/experimental Playstation 1 emulator written in the Rust programming language. It is most notable for being the originator of the OpenGL hardware renderer used in the popular Beetle-PSX-HW core. Since this core is largely incomplete, the aforementioned Beetle-PSX-HW, Swanstation or even PCSX-ReARMed cores are more useful for actually playing games, but this core remains useful for technical/historical purposes."
