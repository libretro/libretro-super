description = "A fork of the final open-source release of the Redream Dreamcast emulator before the project relicensed and became closed-source. It is missing many of the popular features of the later, closed-source releases, such as increased internal resolution and HLE BIOS and, as such, the Flycast-libretro core is typically a much better option for actually playing games via libretro. This core remains for historical value and in case future developers wish to learn from or further develop the codebase."
