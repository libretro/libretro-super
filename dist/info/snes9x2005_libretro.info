description = "Snes9x 2005 is a fork of the classic and popular SNES emulator Snes9x from circa 2005. This core is significantly faster than the newer cores, but that speed comes at the price of accuracy, and this core has some bugs in mostly obscure games and lower audio quality. This core is ideal for very weak devices, such as New 3DS and single-board computers. Users who cannot maintain full speed with this core--much less any of the newer Snes9x cores--should fall back to Snes9x 2002 as a last resort."
