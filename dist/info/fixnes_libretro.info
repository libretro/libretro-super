description = "An alpha-stage emulator written as a learning experience, fixNES is a good, simple core for learning how NES emulators are written, but it's not a good choice for general use. Individuals who are looking for a feature-complete, accurate, easily-usable emulator should look instead to Mesen, Nestopia or FCEUmm, depending on their use-case."
