description = "A port of the Quasi88 emulator for NEC's PC-8000 computer platform to libretro. This core supports built-in BIOS and fonts as fallbacks if the user does not supply their own dumps, and it can start using between 0 and 6 disks as content using the subsystem interface. It does not support the disk control interface but instead uses the dpad in conjunction with the L and R shoulder buttons to cycle among disks in the first and second drive positions, respectively."
