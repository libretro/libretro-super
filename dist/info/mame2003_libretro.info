description = "Based on a snapshot of the MAME codebase circa 2003 (v0.78), 'MAME 2003' is compatible with MAME 0.78 ROM sets. MAME 2003/-Plus cores have tighter integration with libretro features than the more modern snapshots and are significantly faster, though this comes at a substantial reduction in both accuracy and compatibility. These cores are ideal for very weak hardware, such as Raspberry Pi and other Single-Board Computers and consoles, where even FBNeo may be too demanding. If you do not need the additional libretro features and your device can run any newer snapshot core or FBNeo, those are probably better choices for most users."
