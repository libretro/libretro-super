description = "Based on a snapshot of the MAME codebase circa 2015, 'UME 2015' is compatible with MAME 0.160 ROM sets. MAME is the most compatible emulator in the world, and it can run almost any game from any platform. This core specifically includes the non-Arcade portions of the MAME software list. If your device can run the up-to-date MAME - Current core (or any other newer snapshot) at full speed, most users will have a better experience with that core, since it has the benefit of years more development and accuracy improvements behind it."
