description = "Based on a snapshot of the MAME codebase circa 2009, 'MAME 2009' is compatible with MAME 0.135u4 ROM sets. If your device can run the up-to-date MAME - Current core (or any other newer snapshot) at full speed, most users will have a better experience with that core, while FBNeo is typically a better choice for speed vs accuracy, as long as it supports the game(s) in question. This core was created specifically for the performance concerns of the Wii U console, but should also work well on other moderately low-powered devices."
