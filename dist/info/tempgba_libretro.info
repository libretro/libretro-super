description = "A fork of the PSP-specific TempGBA emulator for the Game Boy Advance console, ported to libretro. This core is only intended for use on Playstation Portable hardware, and, as a device-optimized fork of gpSP, it is intended to provide a better, more playable experience for GBA games on this low-powered device. Anyone using any other device should stick with the regular gpSP core or--even better--a more accurate core, such as mGBA."
