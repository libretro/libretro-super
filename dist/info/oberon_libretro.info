description = "An emulator for the Oberon RISC machine, ported to libretro. Oberon System was designed and implemented in 1990 as an example of a modern, interactive operating system with windows and mouse, and it was designed to be simple and well-structured enough to be published in its entirety for teaching purposes. More information on Oberon is available at the website of its creator, Niklaus Wirth (https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/)."
