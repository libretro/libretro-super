description = "DuckStation is a PlayStation 1 (aka PSX) emulator focusing on playability, speed, graphical enhancements, and long-term maintainability. A 'BIOS' ROM image is required to start the emulator and to play games. Features include hardware rendering (OpenGL, Vulkan and D3D11), upscaling, 24-bit color, and a dynamic recompiler (x86-64, ARMv7, AArch64)."
